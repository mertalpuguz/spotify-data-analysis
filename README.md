# spotify-data-analysis
Project Overview:
This project is focused on analyzing Spotify listening history to explore changes in musical preferences and to build a music recommendation system. The analysis involves examining shifts in music genres and moods pre- and post-pandemic. The recommendation system uses machine learning techniques to suggest similar songs based on user input.

My Hypothesis: I hypothesize that the kinds of music that I am listening to after the pandemic have more cultural genres like Turkish pop, and Turkish classics than pre-pandemic. 
Data Analysis: Analyze changes in music preferences over time, focusing on genres and mood (valence, energy, tempo).

Music Recommendation: Recommend songs similar to a user's chosen track based on various musical features.

Data:
The project utilizes personal Spotify listening history. The data is divided into two periods:

Pre-pandemic period and
Post-pandemic period
Each dataset includes information about the tracks such as 'Track Name', 'Artist Name', 'Valence', 'Energy', 'Tempo', and more.

Setup and Installation:
To set up this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

Pandas,
Scikit-learn,
Matplotlib (for data visualization),

Data Analysis:

Run the data analysis script to see changes in music preferences.
Visualizations include histograms, box plots, and bar graphs.

Music Recommendation:

Use the recommend_song function to input a song name.
The system will output a list of similar songs based on the selected features.
